# Create Your First Codelab

This guide walks you through creating a complete codelab using all core features of Open Codelabs.

## What is a codelab?

A codelab is a step-by-step learning guide. Each codelab:

- Consists of multiple **steps**
- Uses **Markdown** content
- Can include **code samples** and images
- Lets attendees proceed at **their own pace**

## Step 1: Create a codelab

### Access the admin dashboard

1. Log in at [http://localhost:5173/login](http://localhost:5173/login)
2. Open the admin dashboard

### Create a new codelab

Click "Create New Codelab" and enter the details:

```
Title: Build a REST API with Rust
Description: Create a RESTful API server using Axum
Author: Jane Doe
```

!!! tip "Writing a good title"
    - Be clear and specific
    - Make the outcome obvious
    - Keep it concise (about 20-50 characters)

## Step 2: Organize steps

### Step structure design

A good codelab is organized into logical steps:

1. **Overview** - introduce what will be learned
2. **Setup** - install tools and dependencies
3. **Core concepts** - explain the theory
4. **Practice** - implement step by step
5. **Testing** - verify the result
6. **Wrap-up** - recap and next steps

### Step 1: Overview

```markdown
# Rust REST API Overview

## What will we build?

In this codelab, you will build a simple TODO REST API using Axum.

## What you will learn

- Axum basics
- RESTful API design principles
- SQLite integration
- Error handling

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal
- Postman or curl

## Estimated time

About 45 minutes
```

### Step 2: Environment setup

```markdown
# Environment Setup

## Create the project

Create a new Rust project:

```bash
cargo new todo-api
cd todo-api
```

## Add dependencies

Open `Cargo.toml` and add the dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
sqlx = { version = "0.8", features = ["runtime-tokio-rustls", "sqlite"] }
```

## Project structure

Create the following structure:

```
todo-api/
|-- Cargo.toml
|-- src/
|   |-- main.rs
|   |-- models.rs
|   `-- handlers.rs
`-- .env
```

!!! info "Nice work"
    The setup is complete. Move to the next step.
```

### Step 3: Write the data models

```markdown
# Data Models

## Define the Todo struct

Create `src/models.rs` with the following code:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Todo {
    pub id: i64,
    pub title: String,
    pub completed: bool,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct CreateTodo {
    pub title: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct UpdateTodo {
    pub title: Option<String>,
    pub completed: Option<bool>,
}
```

## Code explanation

### The Todo struct

- `id`: unique identifier
- `title`: task title
- `completed`: completion flag

### Serde derives

- `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`: JSON serialization/deserialization
- `#[derive(Clone)]`: allows cloning

!!! warning "Note"
    `CreateTodo` does not include `id` or `completed`.
    These are generated by the server.
```

## Step 3: Advanced Markdown features

### Code highlighting

You can highlight code blocks for different languages:

````markdown
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
````

### Admonitions

You can highlight important information:

```markdown
!!! note "Note"
    This is general information.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Useful advice goes here.

!!! warning "Warning"
    This requires caution.

!!! danger "Danger"
    This is critical.

!!! success "Success"
    Success message.

!!! info "Info"
    Additional info.
```

### Tables

```markdown
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /todos | List all todos |
| GET | /todos/:id | Get a todo by id |
| POST | /todos | Create a todo |
| PUT | /todos/:id | Update a todo |
| DELETE | /todos/:id | Delete a todo |
```

### Links and images

```markdown
<!-- External link -->
[Rust Documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

<!-- Image -->
![Architecture Diagram](https://example.com/architecture.png)

<!-- Image uploads -->
Upload images in the admin UI to get a URL.
```

### Lists

```markdown
<!-- Unordered list -->
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

<!-- Ordered list -->
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

<!-- Checklist -->
- [ ] Todo
- [x] Done
- [ ] Remaining
```

## Step 4: Add images

### Upload images

1. Click "Upload Image" in the step editor
2. Select a file (PNG, JPG, GIF)
3. Copy the generated URL
4. Insert into Markdown:

```markdown
![Alt text](uploaded_image_url)
```

### Resize images

Use HTML to control size:

```html
<img src="image_url" alt="Description" width="400">
<img src="image_url" alt="Description" style="width: 50%;">
```

## Step 5: Manage attendees

### Attendee codes

An attendee code is generated automatically when you create a codelab. Attendees enter it when joining.

### Monitor attendees

In the admin dashboard:

- View the attendee list in real time
- Track each attendee's progress
- Manage help requests

### Handle help requests

When an attendee requests help:

1. A notification appears
2. Check which step they are stuck on
3. Provide help via 1:1 DM
4. Mark the issue as resolved

## Step 6: Use real-time chat

### Global chat

Communicate with all attendees:

```
[Facilitator]: We will move on in 5 minutes.
```

### 1:1 DM

Talk to a specific attendee:

```
Click the "DM" button next to the attendee name
-> Send a private message
```

## Step 7: Export and import

### Export a codelab

1. Select a codelab in the admin dashboard
2. Click "Export"
3. Download the ZIP file

ZIP file structure:

```
codelab_xxx.zip
|-- codelab.json        # metadata
|-- step_1.md           # Step 1 content
|-- step_2.md           # Step 2 content
`-- step_3.md           # Step 3 content
```

### Import a codelab

1. Click "Import"
2. Select the ZIP file
3. The codelab and steps are created automatically

!!! tip "Version control"
    Exporting a codelab makes it easy to version with Git.

## Step 8: Collect feedback

When attendees complete a codelab, a feedback form is shown automatically:

- **Difficulty**: 1-5
- **Satisfaction**: 1-5
- **Comments**: free-form

Admins can review all feedback in the dashboard.

## Best practices

### Content authoring

1. Cover only one concept per step
2. Keep code short and explanations clear
3. Focus on hands-on practice
4. Provide verification steps

### Step length

- Ideal step length: 5-10 minutes
- Split overly long steps
- End each step with a summary

### Visual assets

- Use diagrams for complex ideas
- Include screenshots for results
- Visualize architecture with diagrams

### Error handling

- Include common error cases
- Provide clear resolutions
- Add troubleshooting tips

```markdown
